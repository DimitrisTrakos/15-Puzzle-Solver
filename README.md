# 15-Puzzle-Solver
A* and IDS implementation

# Summary
The 15 Puzzle consists of 15 squares numbered from 1 to 15 that are placed in a 4 by 4 box with one empty position. The objective of the puzzle is to reposition the squares by sliding them one at a time into a configuration with the numbers in order.
# Description
This repository is an implementation of the 15-PUZZLE problem with the IDS and A* algorithm using the Manhattan distance as a heuristic.

List.h: This is where the data structures for the list of nodes are defined as well as its functions.

Node.h: Defines the data structure for the node representation, which contains.

State.h: Defines the data structure for representing the state of the node as well as the operations performed on the states.

Io.h: Contains functions related to program output functions.

Main.c: Defines the main procedure of the program. Implementations of the two algorithms are also contained here.
